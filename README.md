## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (latest LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EgleGriciute/parabank_website_full_testing_portfolio-playwright.git
   cd parabank_website_full_testing_portfolio-playwright
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install Playwright browsers:
   ```bash
   npx playwright install --with-deps
   ```

## Running Tests

### Run Tests with UI Mode
For interactive testing with Playwright UI:
```bash
npm run test:ui
```

### Run All Tests Headlessly
Run all tests in headless mode:
```bash
npm run headless
```

### Generate Tests
Use Playwright's codegen to generate tests:
```bash
npm run codegen
```

### Run Parallel Tests
Execute spec tests in parallel:
```bash
npm run parallel:test
```

## Test Data
The framework uses @faker-js/faker for generating dynamic test data. This approach ensures tests are not reliant on static data and can be executed multiple times without data conflicts.

## CI/CD Integration
This project is integrated with GitHub Actions for continuous integration (dev branch). The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/playwright.yml` and runs tests automatically on push and pull requests.

## Reports
After test execution, Playwright generates HTML reports that provide detailed information about test runs, including test status, duration, and screenshots/videos for failed tests. These reports are available in the `playwright-report` directory.
